# Simple-Portfolio-design

While preparing for the ECPC, I decided to take a small break and build something fun and expressive.  
This is a simple personal intro page built using only HTML and CSS no frameworks, no JavaScript, just clean markup and styling.

## ðŸ“Œ What it includes
- A short bio section
- Aesthetic, minimal color palette
- My own photo (just for fun)
- A page for my projects (They are randomly generated since I haven't made many projects yet)

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3 
- JavaScript

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The goal of this project was to mix a bit of creativity into my ECPC prep. Itâ€™s a small creative detour from solving problems with code all day.
